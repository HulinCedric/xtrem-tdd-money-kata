## Implement Portfolio

From now on, we would like to handle operations between amounts in different currencies:
- [ ] 5 USD + 10 EUR = 17 USD
- [ ] 1 USD + 1100 KRW = 2200 KRW

We need to bring a new business concept to our implementation: a `Portfolio`.

Basically, a `Portfolio` contains a **list of amounts in various currencies**. 

Taking our first example above, it could contain `5 USD` and `10 EUR`.

We should be able to **evaluate** the full `Portfolio` amount in a **given currency**:
- `USD` => `17 USD`
- `EUR` => `14,1 EUR`
- `KRW` => `18940 KRW`
- etc.

Your mission in this iteration is to implement the `Portfolio`.

### Write a first test: 5 USD + 10 EUR = 17 USD
Don't forget to write your code using `TDD`.

Small reminder regarding it: the `Red` step is either a test failure or a compilation error.

Please take some time to read how to [generate Code From Usage](https://xtrem-tdd.netlify.app/Flavours/generate-code-from-usage).

There are different strategies when you want to go from a `red` state to a `green` state:
- `Fake it until you make it`
- `Obvious implementation`
- `Triangulation`

We recommend to use `Fake it until you make it` for this first one.

> What is necessary to be able to convert from 1 `Currency` to another?

You need to inject an instance of the `Bank` in the `Portfolio`. You have 2 options:
- Constructor injection
- Method injection

### Write a second test: 1 USD + 1100 KRW = 2200 KRW
Write a new failing test.

Use `Fake it until you make it` once again.

### Triangulation
Now that you have 2 test cases, you can now use `Triangulation` and refactor the production code to get you closer to the "final" solution.
Your 2 test cases will act as a safety net for your refactoring.

### What can be improved?
Always think about what could happen at the edge of your system.

- From your code implementation, what happens if we add in the same `Portfolio` many amounts of the same currency?
  - We need to increase our confidence by adding a new test on it: `5 USD + 10 EUR + 4 EUR = 21.8 USD` for example
- Regarding the current implementation, we may improve error handling and throws a global exception with the details of all the missing exchange rates
  - Instead of throwing an `Exception` on the first one missing

### Add a new Test Case: 5 USD + 10 EUR + 4 EUR = 21.8 USD
Write this new [failing] test.

### Improve error handling
If we have multiple missing exchange rates we return the information only for the first missing one...
Let's improve it: write a new test that will drive you to the final implementation.

The test could look like this: `1 EUR + 1 USD + 1 KRW = ? EUR`

You can generate a new `MissingExchangeRatesException` to represent this `Exception`.

### Reflect
During this iteration we have implemented a `Portfolio` that allows to add different amounts in different currencies. 

Let's take a look at your test cases.

With what we implemented during this iteration, it would make sense to use only the `Portfolio` to add moneys together.

So let's move `add` test from `MoneyCalculator` in the `Portfolio` tests suite.

Now that you removed the test from MoneyCalculator, you can also remove the `add` method as it's not being used anymore.
