# Only Immutable Types
- Let's identify mutable types
  - Find where we have mutations in our classes

```java
public final class Bank {
    ...
    
    public void addExchangeRate(Currency from, Currency to, double rate) {
        exchangeRates.put(keyFor(from, to), rate);
    }

    ...
}

public final class Portfolio {
    ...
    public void add(Money money) {
        moneys.add(money);
    }
    ...
}
```

## Bank
- We start by the `Bank` implementation
  - What we want to achieve by making it immutable is to have a method `addExchangeRate` with a signature like this `Currency` -> `Currency` -> `double` -> `Bank`
  - Let's start by adapting a test to make it `red`
    - We don't compile

![Failure from Bank](img/immutable-types-bank.png)

- Make it `green`
```java
public Bank addExchangeRate(Currency from, Currency to, double rate) {
    var updateExchangeRates = exchangeRates;
    updateExchangeRates.put(keyFor(from, to), rate);

    return new Bank(updateExchangeRates);
}
```
- Now we can refactor
  - Let's simplify our test
```java
@Test
@DisplayName("Conversion with different exchange rates EUR to USD")
void shouldConvertWithDifferentExchangeRates() throws MissingExchangeRateException {
    assertThat(bank.convert(euros(10), USD))
            .isEqualTo(dollars(12));

    assertThat(bank.addExchangeRate(EUR, USD, 1.3)
            .convert(euros(10), USD))
            .isEqualTo(dollars(13));
}
```
- Let's make it impossible to mutate accidentally our `exchangeRates` from the `Bank`
  - We can force it by using `Collections.unmodifiableMap` from the private constructor
```java
public final class Bank {
    private final Map<String, Double> exchangeRates;

    private Bank(Map<String, Double> exchangeRates) {
        this.exchangeRates = Collections.unmodifiableMap(exchangeRates);
    }

    ...

    public Bank addExchangeRate(Currency from, Currency to, double rate) {
        var updateExchangeRates = new HashMap<>(exchangeRates);
        updateExchangeRates.put(keyFor(from, to), rate);

        return new Bank(updateExchangeRates);
    }
}
```
